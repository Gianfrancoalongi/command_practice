command_practice
================

*nix command practice repository containing practice session set-up scripts.
For each practice type, just execute the script in a place where you have write permissions.
The script will set up the necessary practice environment (catalogs/files) and output instructions.

Do not read the script source code before the practice, as the scripts contain spoilers.
